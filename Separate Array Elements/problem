1. where is the memory leak happens in Javascript ?
2. if we declare interface in Typescript, how it will convert into Javascript ?
3. Main difference between Typescript and Javascript ?

1. input = [ 'A', 'B','C', 1, 2, 3, '4', '5', 6, '@', '~', 'D' ]
 
                 * Split the string, integer, and special characters into new arrays. 

                 * Make sure 4 and 5 which is a string should be in integer array list and convert it to integer.
 
         Console Output:

                 integer = [1,2,3,4,5,6]  

                 string = [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' ]

                 chars = [ '@', '~' ]  
 
2. Follow-up questions for integer array.

            integer = [1,2,3,4,5,6] 

                 * Split it to 2 arrays with random elements and sum each array

                   example:

                          Output_1:

                            array_1 = [ 1,4,6 ]

                            array_2 = [ 2,3,5 ]   

                          Output_2: Sum each array

                            array_1 = 11

                            array_2 = 10 

    The execution of the code after follow-up question. The output should be like this.
 
   

       Output:

                              integer = [1,2,3,4,5,6] 

                                        array_1 = [ 1,4,6 ]

                                        array_2 = [ 2,3,5 ]

                                               array_1_total = 11

                                               array_2_total = 10
